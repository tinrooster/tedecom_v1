# Frontend Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the frontend implementation for the Tedecom (Technical Equipment Decommissioning) project. The frontend is built using React with TypeScript and Material UI for a consistent and responsive user interface.

## Components

### Layout Component
A responsive layout component that provides the structure for the application:
- Drawer for navigation
- App bar with user information and actions
- Navigation menu with links to different sections
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

### StatusBadge Component
A reusable component for displaying status indicators:
- Color-coded badges for different statuses (pending, in progress, completed, failed)
- Customizable appearance
- Tooltip support for additional information

### DataTable Component
A powerful table component with advanced features:
- Sorting capabilities for all columns
- Pagination for handling large datasets
- Filtering options for quick data retrieval
- Row selection for batch operations
- Export functionality

### SearchFilter Component
A component for advanced filtering:
- Support for different field types (text, number, date, select)
- Dynamic filter creation
- Saved filter presets
- Clear and apply filter actions

### DecommissionWorkflow Component
A component for managing equipment decommissioning workflows:
- Step tracking with status indicators
- User assignment for each step
- Timeline visualization
- Comments and attachments
- Approval mechanisms

## Pages

### DecommissionWorkflowPage
A dedicated page for managing individual decommissioning workflows:
- Detailed view of workflow steps
- Equipment information
- Audit trail
- Action buttons for workflow progression

## Service Updates

### workflowService.ts
Added functions for:
- Creating and updating workflows
- Managing workflow steps
- Assigning users to steps
- Tracking workflow progress
- Generating workflow reports

### authService.ts
Added functions for:
- User authentication
- Role-based access control
- User profile management
- Password reset functionality
- Session management

### equipmentService.ts
Added functions for:
- Equipment inventory management
- Equipment status tracking
- Equipment search and filtering
- Equipment history tracking
- Bulk operations

## App Updates
- Added routes for new pages in App.tsx
- Implemented protected routes for authenticated users
- Added role-based access control for sensitive operations
- Improved error handling and loading states

## Best Practices Implemented
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Material UI for consistent design language
- React Router for navigation
- React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Axios for API communication
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Comprehensive error handling
- Loading states for better user experience

## Next Steps
- Install Dependencies: Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- Start Development Server: Run `npm start` to start the development server
- Backend Integration: Ensure the backend API is properly configured
- Testing: Comprehensive testing of all components and workflows
- Deployment: Deploy to production environment
